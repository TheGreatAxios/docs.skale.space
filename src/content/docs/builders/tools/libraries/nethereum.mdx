    introParagraph="Nethereum is a .NET integration library for Ethereum, enabling developers to interact with EVM chains and smart contracts using the C# programming language.
     It provides a set of APIs and utilities to facilitate communication with the Ethereum blockchain."

The main features of this web3 library are:

- JSON RPC / IPC Ethereum core methods
- Simplified smart contract interaction for deployment, function calling, transaction and event filtering and decoding of topics
- [Unity 3d](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/unity3d-introduction/) integration
- ABI to .Net type encoding and decoding, including attribute-based for complex object serialization
- Libraries for standard contracts Token, [ENS](https://ens.domains/) and [Uport](https://www.uport.me/)
- Key storage using Web3 storage standard, compatible with Geth and Parity.

## Implementation Example

The Nethereum.Unity library is a Nethereum specific Unity library and api which provides support for UnityWebRequest to interact with Ethereum using RPC over Http.

All Nethereum releases can be found [here](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum/releases).

The following example showcases how to get the current balance of a wallet.


**Get Balance Example**
``` csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
using Nethereum.Web3;
using Nethereum.RPC.Eth.DTOs;
using Nethereum.Unity.Rpc;

  public IEnumerator GetWalletBalance()
    {
        string chain_rpc = "";
        string wallet_address = "";

        var balanceRequest = new EthGetBalanceUnityRequest(chain_rpc);
        yield return balanceRequest.SendRequest(wallet_address, BlockParameter.CreateLatest());
        var balance = Web3.Convert.FromWei(balanceRequest.Result.Value);

        Debug.Log("Wallet Balance " + balance);
    }
```

### Nethereum Playground

In order to quickly experiment Nethereum library and it's capabilities, it was created a platform where developers can learn and run predefined examples that show how to make some requests. It can be useful to help developers deciding if Nethereum is a good fit for their project. 
To try it out check https://playground.nethereum.com/.

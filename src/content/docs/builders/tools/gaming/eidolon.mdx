## Features

- **Blockchain Interaction**: Eidolon.Unity allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain effortlessly. With just a few lines of code, you can perform various operations, such as sending transactions, reading contract data, and managing accounts.

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect to popular browser wallets like MetaMask, TrustWallet, and Enkrypt. Eidolon.Unity seamlessly integrates with these wallets, providing your users with a familiar and secure way to manage their assets.

- **ERC Standards Support**: Eidolon.Unity supports Ethereumâ€™s ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 token standards, enabling you to work with a wide range of blockchain assets and NFTs.

- **WebGL Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with Unity WebGL, Eidolon.Unity ensures that your games can be easily deployed to the web, allowing players to experience your blockchain-powered creations directly in their browsers.

- **Native Gas distribution**: Due to the zero gas fees of SKALE, in order to allow users performing transactions the dApps need to implement a gas token distribution or sFUEL distribution. Eidolon already takes care of that for the developers.

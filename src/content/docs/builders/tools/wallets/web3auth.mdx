Pluggable wallet infrastructure for Web3 wallets and applications. It streamlines the onboarding of both mainstream and crypto native users in under a minute by providing experiences that they're most comfortable with.
    Web3Auth's MPC-based wallet management infrastructure provides secure, non-custodial wallet management, where users maintain control of their cryptographic key pair. The login service only accesses a single share, preventing the provider from retrieving the user's wallet independently.

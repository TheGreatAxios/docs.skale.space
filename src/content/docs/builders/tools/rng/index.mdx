Random Number Generation (RNG) has many applications in software development [both Web2 and Web3].
It can be used to support generation of secure credentials, support with decision making, 
and allow games to have elements of randomness that create far more engaging experiences.

Random number generation, often referred to as VRF (Verifiable Random Function) due to
the popular Chainlink VRF functionality is very common with developers building in blockchain.

SKALE Chains all come with the RNG endpoint available directly in Solidity with zero gas fees.

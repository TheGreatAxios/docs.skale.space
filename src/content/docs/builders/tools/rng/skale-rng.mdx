Each SKALE Chain includes a built-in random number generator (RNG) that produces
a new random number with every block. This RNG is derived from the threshold signature
shares of at least 11 out of 16 SKALE nodes supporting the chain.

SKALE chain consensus is asynchronous and leaderless, with blocks signed by a minimum of 11 out of 16 nodes.
The signatures are combined in a way that prevents any single node from influencing the final outcome,
ensuring the randomness cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any individual entity.

Steps to achieve the random number:
<Steps>
1. Signatures for the current block are retrieved.
2. The BLAKE3 hash of the signatures is created.
3. The resulting hex RNG is presented.
</Steps>

## Implementation Example

<Steps>

1. #### Code to retrieve the random bytes

    The code bellow showcases how to use the pre-compiled RNG. It showcases how to access the `getBlockRandom` precompiled at the address `0x18`.

    ```solidity
        pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

        contract A {

        function getRandom() public view returns (bytes32 addr) {
            assembly {
                let freemem := mload(0x40)
                let start_addr := add(freemem, 0)
                if iszero(staticcall(gas(), 0x18, 0, 0, start_addr, 32)) {
                    invalid()
                }
                addr := mload(freemem)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. #### Returned random bytes

    Running the `getRandom()` function several times returns something similar to the following example. Each different result corresponds to a new block: 

    ```sh 
    0:bytes32: addr 0xb01da4532b80108eee3d00d48d6c617869eabfa39acbb58b7fd44e8369331501
    0:bytes32: addr 0x48e4af915a9cf211474c11fec16dd40164a1d6d82dec93a646b4b776261a9fe5
    0:bytes32: addr 0x7d95dd4d341e6bf27ce37e1dc531319daa1dfd75efe4a5f1b1de1f3062425155
    0:bytes32: addr 0x80494d5289618a28ca5ed57803404a4c3b379699d81ae1badf408fb8341c8ef7
    0:bytes32: addr 0xfd66a3c359c1c73f285f881105bb8ef5185cc04d5c8c7360c4386f0673ecc98b
    0:bytes32: addr 0xb95f1c2be3b13371115b8e6431461a24e960f0bb9881420993528ce68b019f75
    ```

3. #### Converting random bytes into uint256

    The random bytes returned by the `getRandom()` function can be handled in different ways depending on the use case. One of the most common cases is generating a simple random uint256. 

    To achieve the random uint256 its only required to cast the random bytes into a uint256:

    ```solidity
    function getRandomNumber() public view returns (uint256) {
        return uint256(getRandom());
    }
    ```
4. #### Examples
    For more examples, like generating a random number within a specific range or generating two random numbers from the same block, check out the documentation at: https://docs.dirtroad.dev/skale/skale-rng/.

## Libraries

[SKALE RNG by Dirt Road Development](https://docs.dirtroad.dev/skale/skale-rng) is an NPM library available for free
and fully MIT licensed that offers developers both the RNG endpoint pre-packaged as well as a number of helper functions
to quickly help developers build on SKALE.

### Using SKALE RNG

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "@dirtroad/skale-rng/contracts/RNG.sol";

contract SomeContract is RNG {

    function _getRandomNumber() {
        uint256 num = getRandomNumber();
    }

    function _getRandomNumberInRange() {
        uint256 num = getRandomRange(5); // Num between 0 and 5
    }
}
```

Meson can be integrated in three different ways in an application:

- **[Link](https://meson.dev/getting-started/link-integration)**: This method requires merely adding a link. A popup window will then guide the user to complete the cross-chain transfer. Link integration is a fast and easy way to integrate Meson, ideal for platforms wanting a quick setup to leverage Meson's cross-chain capabilities.

- **[SDK](https://meson.dev/getting-started/sdk-integration)**: For a more seamless user experience, you can install the meson.to SDK. Beyond the features of Link integration, SDK integration displays your app name & icon, and enables direct interaction with your app's smart contract during a cross-chain transfer.

- **[API](https://meson.dev/getting-started/api-integration)**: If you prefer backend integration, you can directly use the Meson protocol through APIs.

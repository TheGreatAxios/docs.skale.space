LayerZero is an interoperability protocol designed to link blockchains, enabling developers to create fluid omnichain applications, tokens, and experiences. Utilizing immutable on-chain endpoints, a customizable Security Stack, and an open set of Executors, the protocol facilitates the transfer of censorship-resistant messages across chains.

## Features

- **Multiple Networks:** SKALE Europa is connected with a lot of diferent networks.

- **Messaging Protocol:** LayerZero allows to exchange any kind of message between chains, which means that all kind of tokens standards (ex: ERC-20, ERC-721 or ERC-1155) can be bridged.

- **layerZero Scan:** [Explorer](https://layerzeroscan.com/) to track the mainnet and testnet cross-chain messages.
## Quickstart

<Steps>

1. Select the type of contract standard you want to use [here](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/overview).

2. On your terminal run the following command for a quick project setup

    ```sh
        npx create-lz-oapp@latest
    ```


3. Select the OFT Standard.

    <Aside> For this example we'll use the OFT standard which combines the ERC-20 token standard with the core bridge logic</Aside>

4. Use the [OFT Alt](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/oft-patterns-extensions#oft-alt) standard for the token on SKALE.

    <Aside> The OFT Alt should be used on SKALE to enable SKL tokens as bridge payment instead of sFUEL, which has no economic value.</Aside>

## Features

- **Decentralized Data Indexing:** Allows developers to create and query open APIs (subgraphs) for accessing blockchain data efficiently.

- **GraphQL-Based Queries:** Provides a robust GraphQL interface for retrieving structured and specific on-chain data seamlessly.

- **Data Hosting:** Requires the developer to self host the graph node.

- **SKALE Chains:** Available to use on all SKALE Chains. 

## Quickstart

1. Reach out to the Graph community to request a Graph node, or you may run your own Graph node.

2. Point the Graph node to a SKALE Archive node or indexing node.

3. Clone the following [github repository](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node). 

4. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/README.md).

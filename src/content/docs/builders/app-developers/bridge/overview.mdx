title: Overview of SKALE Bridge
description: IMA is the native SKALE Bridge and Messaging Protocol
---

SKALE Network has has its own native messaging and bridging protocol called
Interchain Messaging Agent or IMA for short. IMA connects each and every SKALE
Chain to the Ethereum Mainnet as well as each SKALE Chain to every other SKALE Chain.

It is a fully modular system where the base messaging layer has the ability to transfer
any arbitrary data between two chains -- whether Ethereum to SKALE, vice versa, or SKALE to SKALE --
while also having a number of prebuilt modules on top of it which facilitate token movement for
popular ERCs standards.

## Relation to Ethereum

IMA is backed by Ethereum mainnet and SKALE Chain security mechanisms - It uses your SKALE Chainâ€™s 16 randomly selected validator nodes to sign and verify messages between the Ethereum mainnet and your SKALE Chain using BLS threshold signatures and Trusted-Execution Environments (TEE). It uses smart contracts running on Ethereum to manage the locking and unlocking of the deposit box on the mainnet. And, each of the 16 nodes supporting your SKALE Chain each has 20 million SKL tokens staked.

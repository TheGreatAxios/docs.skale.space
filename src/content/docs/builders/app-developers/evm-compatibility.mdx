description: SKALE and EVM Compatibility
---

The SKALE execution model is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM). This allows any smart contract that works on other EVMs to work on SKALE
with no changes necessary.

## Supported Languages

### Solidity

Solidity is the most popular language for writing smart contracts for EVM
blockchains, including SKALE Chains. Being turing complete with a
JavaScript-like syntax, Solidity empowers developers to build smart contracts
that can run on a SKALE Chain.

:::tip[Developer Warning]
The EVM Compiler version Shanghai is not compatible
with SKALE Chains at this time. If using v0.8.20 or greater, you must manually
set the EVM Version to Paris or lower. Fore more information, see the
[Solidity Language Announcement](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement)

#### EIPS & Popular Standards

Since Solidity itself compiles to EVM compatible bytecode, many of the Ethereum
Improvement Proposals ([EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/)) that take shape in the
form of Ethereum Request for Comment ([ERC](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc)), are
also usable directly on SKALE with no changes needed. Examples of these popular
standards include [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) (Fungible
Token Standard), [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) (Non-Fungible
Token Standard), and [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) (Multi
Token Standard).

### Vyper

Vyper is a pythonic language that targets the EVM. Vyper does not try to replace
Solidity, but instead focuses on simplicity.

### Yul

Yul is an intermediate language that can be compiled into bytecode. It can be
used stand-alone or inside Solidity.

## Supported Tooling

With SKALE Chains being EVM compatible, any tool or software that is
chain-agnostic -- meaning it can run on any EVM chain -- should just work on
SKALE! While some tools may not have docs directly for SKALE, any tooling that
allows you to input your a custom RPC will generally be compatible.

For more tools, checkout the [tools section](/tools).

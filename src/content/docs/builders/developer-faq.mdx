### Can I port smart contracts from Ethereum to SKALE?

Yes! SKALE is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning developers can seamlessly port their Ethereum-based smart contracts to SKALE without modifications. SKALE’s optimized EVM also enables faster transactions and greater  throughput compared to Ethereum.

### Can I port smart contracts from Ethereum Alt-L1s and Layer-2s to SKALE?

Yes!. Since most Alt-L1s and Layer-2 networks (like Avalanche and Base) are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, developers can seamlessly port their smart contracts to SKALE. With SKALE’s zero gas fees and native integrations (like onchain RNG).

### What are the benefits of building on SKALE?
- **Zero Gas Fees**: Users do not pay gas fees, providing a seamless Web2-like experience. Developers can optionally use gasless transactions to further reduce friction while still ensuring gas fees are free.
- **High Throughput**: SKALE Chains can handle 400 transactions per second (TPS)
- **Limitless Scalability**: SKALE’s modular architecture enables independent AppChains and shared HubChains to coexist within the same network. Additional chains can be added as needed as developers require more capacity
- **Native Features**: SKALE chains offer a number of unique native integrations that can save both time and effort for developers while also improving the applications being built
These integrations include:
	- Native Random Number Generation (RNG)
	- Native File Storage
	- Native Oracle
	- Gasless Transactions
	- Native Messaging Protocol
	- Native Bridge
- **Instant Finality**: Transactions are confirmed instantly with SKALE’s consensus protocol
- **Interoperability**: SKALE Chains can communicate with each other and bridge to Ethereum efficiently

### What grants does SKALE offer for developers?
SKALE offers various grant programs, including:

- **Innovator Program**: Supports projects launching on SKALE AppChains or Community Hub Chains. Benefits include engineering support, co-marketing, and investor introductions
- **Gaming Grants**: Targets Web3 games, providing support for minting, scaling, and seamless onboarding with zero gas fees.
- **AI Grants**: Supports AI projects that combine blockchain with AI/ML models, such as AI Agents, Onchain autonomous AI, and more

### Does SKALE have a strong userbase?
Yes. SKALE has achieved significant adoption with over 800 million on-chain transactions and 45 million unique active wallets in its first 4 years, highlighting the network’s growing popularity and real-world usage.

### What does "invisible blockchain" mean?
SKALE’s “invisible blockchain” concept refers to its ability to deliver a seamless user experience similar to traditional Web2 applications. Features such as zero gas fees, instant finality, and simplified user onboarding ensure that users interact with decentralized applications without needing to understand or pay blockchain transaction fees.

### What dApps are most popular on SKALE?

SKALE supports a diverse range of decentralized applications, with a strong focus on gaming, AI, DeFi, and DePIN.

### How do SKALE Chains achieve zero gas fees?

SKALE eliminates gas fees through a subscription-based model where developers pay for network resources rather than end users.

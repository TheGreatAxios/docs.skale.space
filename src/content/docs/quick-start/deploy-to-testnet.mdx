## Guide to deploying to SKALE Testnet

To start, select a chain from the options below.
One of the chains probably aligns with a "category" your dApp falls into. If you don't feel their is a good fit,
no worries, join us in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gM5XBy6) for additional support on where to start building or
select the Calypso Hub.

<SelectChain  />
<GasAndTokens client:load />

## Deploy to SKALE

Now that you have:

- An RPC Endpoint
- Some gas tokens e.g sFUEL
- Some ERC-20 tokens (commonly used)

You can begin deploying to SKALE! If you have deployed to another EVM network in the past,
you can use the same tools and just change the network to the details listed above.

If this is your first time deploying to an EVM network we have listed some popular deployment resources here:

## Introduction

The SKALE Token [SKL] is the first ERC token with Ethereum
native delegation and staking functionality. SKL is a modified
[ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) token backward compatible with the [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard.

<Aside type="note" title="Understanding the Backward Compatibility">
  It's important to note that the backward compatible nature means that
  the SKL token can be viewed on MetaMask, found on popular CEX + DEX, etc.
  The ERC-777 functionality is built-on top of the core ERC-20 standard.
</Aside>

You may use any ERC-20 compatible wallet to hold and delegate your
tokens for/into the SKALE Network. Transfers and approvals work the same
in ERC-777 as in ERC-20 -- the only difference is that ERC-777
allows for certain functions and checks before transfers are executed.
The SKL token uses this pre-transfer function to conduct checks
to ensure that tokens are not actively delegated.

## SKL Holder Actions

### Delegations

The SKL token provides critical utility to the SKALE Network.
SKL token holders have the ability to delegate their tokens to validator
who in turn stake the tokens to create SKALE Nodes. Delegations help
secure the network and in return receive bounty rewards. Delegators
can delegate to multiple validators.

### Governance

Active delegations allow the delegators to participate in the SKALE Network governance
via the SKALE DAO.

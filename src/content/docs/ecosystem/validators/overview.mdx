description: Overview of the SKALE Network Validators
---

SKALE is a network of Layer-1 blockchains -- SKALE Chains -- which have zero gas-fees, infinite scalability,
and are built for best in class UX.

SKALE is unique from other blockchain networks. The SKALE Network has a pool of validators that work together 
to secure the network. These validators provide computation power to the SKALE Network by deploying SKALE Nodes.
The collection of validators and the node(s) they spin up represent the entire validator network that performs
work for SKALE Chains (an Layer-1 Ethereum Compatible Chain). Each SKALE Chain in the network is operated by a
group of virtualized sub-nodes selected from a subset of the nodes run by validators in the SKALE network and
are run on all or a subset [multi-tenancy] of each nodeâ€™s computation and storage resources.

As each node in the network continues to participate in their assigned SKALE Chains, they are each awarded
bounties based upon their performance at the end of each network epoch. Each node is be monitored by their peer
nodes. When a SKALE Chain has reached the end of its lifetime, the resources (computation, storage) of its
virtualized sub-nodes will be freed so that validator nodes may participate in newly created SKALE Chains.

Validator nodes also receive direct payment from SKALE Chain pricing which is "rent" paid by the chain owners/operators
for this compute.

<Steps>

1. ## Setup Validator
    
    <Aside type="note">Due date 20th day of each month</Aside>

    ### 1.1 Prepare

    #### 1.1.1 Obtain Ethereum Software Wallet or Hardware wallet

    Get a Ledger, Hardware or Software wallet ready like Metamask/Portis/Bitski/Torus/myetherwallet.
    Specific setup instructions will follow.

    This wallet will be used for receiving delegation, bounties, and self delegating.

    #### 1.1.2 Fund Validator Wallet with ETH

    Be ready to have some ETH to accept delegations and link your validator node.
    Remember these are transactions with SKALE Manager on Ethereum, and therefore require ETH.

    *Minimum ETH: 1.0*

    #### 1.1.3 Get SKALE Manager contract ABIs from SKALE

    [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skalenetwork/skale-network/master/releases/mainnet/skale-manager/1.11.0/skale-manager-1.11.0-mainnet-abi.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skalenetwork/skale-network/master/releases/mainnet/skale-manager/1.11.0/skale-manager-1.11.0-mainnet-abi.json)

    #### 1.1.4 Fund SRW Wallet with ETH

    Be ready to fund ETH in your self-recharging wallet (SRW). See [Self-recharging wallet documentation](/ecosystem/validators/validator-cli/self-recharding-wallets).

    *Minimum ETH*: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>0.5</mn><mo>&#x2219;</mo><mi>node</mi><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mi>count</mi></mrow></math>

    #### 1.1.5 Decide your commission fee

    Decide on your commission fee. This cannot be changed once it is set. To set a new commission fee, you'll have to register a new validator.
    This new validator would have to link nodes and accept delegations for it (old validator nodes and delegations cannot be rolled into a
    new validator commission fee).

    ### 1.2 Register Validator

    SKALE Validator CLI is the validator client interface for registering a new validator into network or handling additional
    delegation services where validators can self delegate or token holders can delegate to a validator. These are the type of
    operations that can be done with the Validator CLI:

    - Register Validator (Set Commission Rate or Minimum delegation amount)
    - Accept pending delegations
    - Link all validator node addresses to a validator wallet address
    - Request or cancel a delegation

    [See the SKALE Validator CLI documentation](/ecosystem/validators/validator-cli/overview)

    This document contains instructions on how to get started with the SKALE Validator CLI.

    <Aside type="note">
        Validator CLI doesn't have to be installed in the same server as the node-cli. This can be set up on Mac or Linux.
        This does not need to be included in every node. Setting up once per validator organization is sufficient.
    </Aside>

    #### 1.2.1 Install SKALE Validator CLI

    ##### Download the SKALE Validator CLI binary

    `VERSION_NUM` is a version identifier

    ```shell
    VERSION_NUM=[VERSION_NUM] && sudo -E bash -c "curl -L https://github.com/skalenetwork/validator-cli/releases/download/$VERSION_NUM/sk-val-$VERSION_NUM-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >  /usr/local/bin/sk-val"
    ```

    ##### Apply executable permissions to the binary

    ```shell
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sk-val
    ```

    ##### Set SKALE Manager contracts info and set the endpoint

    ```shell
    sk-val init -e [ENDPOINT] -c [ABI] --wallet [software/ledger]
    ```

    Required arguments:

    - `--endpoint/-e` - RPC endpoint of the node in the network where SKALE manager is deployed (http or https). Example is https://my.geth.node.ip/..

    - `--contracts-url/-c` - URL to SKALE Manager contracts ABI and addresses

    - `-w/--wallet` - Type of the wallet that will be used for signing transactions (software or ledger)

    #### 1.2.2 Setup wallet

    ##### Software wallet

    If you want to use software wallet you need to save private key into a file.

    Replace `[YOUR PRIVATE KEY]` with your wallet private key

    ```shell
    echo [YOUR PRIVATE KEY] > ./pk.txt
    ```

    ##### Ledger  wallet

    If you want to use ledger you should install ETH ledger application and  initialize device with `setup-ledger` command.

    ```shell
    sk-val wallet setup-ledger --address-index [ADDRESS_INDEX] --keys-type [KEYS_TYPE]
    ```

    Required arguments:

    -   `--address-index` - Index of the address to use (starting from `0`)
    -   `--keys-type` - Type of the Ledger keys (live or legacy)

    <Aside type="note" title="Important">
    Make sure you enabled blind signing on ETH application settings. Otherwise transactions won't work
    </Aside>
    
    #### 1.2.3 Register as a new SKALE validator

    <Aside type="caution" title="Warning">
    DON'T REGISTER A NEW VALIDATOR IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE! check : `sk-val validator ls`. For additional node set up, please go to Step 3.
    </Aside>

    ```shell
    sk-val validator register -n [NAME] -d [DESCRIPTION] -c [COMMISSION_RATE] --min-delegation [MIN_DELEGATION]
    ```

    Required arguments:

    -   `--name/-n` - Validator name
    -   `--description/-d` - Validator description (preferably organization info)
    -   `--commission-rate/-c` - Commission rate (percent %)
    -   `--min-delegation` - Validator minimum delegation amount

    Optional arguments:

    -   `--pk-file` - Path to file with private key (only for `software` wallet type)
    -   `--gas-price` - Gas price value in Gwei for transaction (if not specified doubled average network value will be used)
    -   `--yes` - Confirmation flag

    ### 1.3 Make sure that your validator is added to the trusted list

    To ensure that your validator is added to trusted contact SKALE team.
